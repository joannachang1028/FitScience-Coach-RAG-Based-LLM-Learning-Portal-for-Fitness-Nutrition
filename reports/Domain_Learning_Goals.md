## Step 1 — Domain, Learning Questions, and Objectives

### Domain
FitScience Coach — Evidence-based fitness and nutrition planning for general users (workouts, calories, macronutrients, micronutrients, sleep/recovery).

### Learning Questions
1. How do I create a weekly workout schedule that progresses safely toward my goals while including proper rest?
2. How much protein, carbs, and fats should I eat daily to support my training goals and fit my lifestyle preferences?
3. What foods should I choose to hit my daily calories and get enough vitamins and minerals?
4. How do I calculate my daily calorie needs for losing fat, gaining muscle, or maintaining weight using my BMR and activity level (NEAT/TDEE)?
5. How do I track NEAT (daily non-exercise movement) and factor it into my calorie planning?
6. What’s the difference between BMR and TDEE, and how do they guide body composition goals?
7. How should I adjust training and nutrition when my schedule, intensity, or goals change?

### Learning Objectives (Bloom’s verbs)
1. Design a weekly training plan with progression, rest, and goal alignment.
2. Synthesize nutrition targets (protein, carbs, fat, calories) with training goals, lifestyle, and preferences.
3. Identify food choices to meet daily calorie and micronutrient needs (vitamins, minerals).
4. Calculate daily calorie needs for fat loss, muscle gain, or maintenance using BMR and NEAT/TDEE.

### Scope Notes
- Audience: general population (beginner-friendly, scalable to intermediate).
- Evidence sources: PubMed/PMC, NIH ODS, NSCA, USDA, NHS, peer-reviewed reviews, high-quality podcasts with expert guests.
